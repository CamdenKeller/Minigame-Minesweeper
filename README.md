# Minigame-Minesweeper

AP Computer Science A Final Project

Our project is effectively a copy of Minesweeper except for the twist that you can win an extra life if you win the minigameâ€¦ unless you hit a super bomb. The three possibilities of minigames when you hit a bomb are the Fighting Game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Random Trivia. You win by uncovering all of the clear spaces.
