# Minigame-Minesweeper
AP Computer Science A Final Project 
Our project is effectively a copy of minesweeper except for the twist that you can win an extra life if you win the minigameâ€¦ unless you hit a sUpEr BoMb. The three possibilities of minigames when you hit a bomb are the Fighting Game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Random Trivia. We used JavaScript in codeHS. You win by uncovering all of the clear spaces.
